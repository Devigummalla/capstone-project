# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots — Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the Summer Analytics 2025 program hosted by the Consulting and Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati. The aim is to develop a **dynamic pricing model** for urban parking lots based on historical occupancy data, competition, time, and real-world constraints.

The solution includes:

- Predicting demand for parking lots
- Dynamic price adjustment using temporal factors
- Competitive pricing using spatial proximity and KDTree optimization
